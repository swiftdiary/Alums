# ALUMS
**Agricultural Land Use Management System**

---

*This repository contains the code for the ALUMS project, an end-to-end agricultural land use management system designed to improve efficiency, scalability, and transparency in monitoring practices for Uzbekistan.*

## Data Sources:

- Sentinel-2 satellite imagery
- Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan


## Tech Stack:

- STAC API (data access)
- Flask (backend development)
- Swift (iOS mobile application)
- PostGIS (spatial database)

## Problems Addressed:

- **Labor Intensive**: Traditional land use monitoring methods are labor-intensive, requiring significant manpower and limiting the scope of monitoring.
- **Limited Scale**: Manual inspections are limited in scale, making it difficult to effectively monitor vast agricultural areas.
- **Prone to Error**: Subjective assessments are prone to human error and potential corruption.

## Solution:

ALUMS provides an automated and objective solution for land use monitoring.

- **End-to-End Pipeline**: The system automates data acquisition, processing, analysis, and visualization.
- **AI-powered Classification**: Utilizes machine learning models for accurate crop type classification using time-series Sentinel-2 imagery.
- **Reduced Costs**: Automates tasks and eliminates the need for extensive manual labor, leading to significant cost savings.

## Getting Started:

This repository is currently under development. Please refer to the individual folders (backend, ios) for specific setup instructions once available.

## Developers:

Mirshod Makhsudov (AI, Backend, GIS)

Akbar Khusanbayev (iOS)

## Additional Notes:

This project was created for a hackathon and is a prototype.
Further development and refinement are required before full deployment.
We welcome contributions to the project!
